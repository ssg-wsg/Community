# SSG Training Ecosystem DLT Network Onboarding Checklist


## Checklist

1. Partners who plan to integrate via DLT need to complete the following initial steps: 
   
    a. To notify your interest or enquiries with DLT integration, you may inform the support team via the [Jira Support Channel](Jira-Support-Channel.pdf).
    
    b. Fill in the relevant forms to onboard to the system.
   
2.  See the [Grants Management Specifications](Specifications/md_files/SSG_Grants_Management_Specs.md) and the [Event Schema](Specifications/md_files/event-schema) to identify and enumerate the APIs that are necessary for your service to connect to (Eg: MySF Course run, Course Session Information, DLT Key Management API)
   
3. To request access to the API endpoints that your application requires, do send the request to the support team through the Jira Support Channel](Jira-Support-Channel.pdf.   
4.  For selected API endpoints, you are required to complete connectivity tests and submit the results for SSG review.
   
5.  Set up your DL Network Stack
   
      See the [Onboarding to the SSG Training Ecosystem DL Network](Specifications/md_files/onboarding/SSG_DLT_Onboarding.md) document for the guidelines. You may refer to the [Partners Reference Architecture](Partners-Reference-Architecture) infra setup. Note that this reference architecure is for AWS and to use this would require an AWS account.

6. Integrate your service to the DL Network Stack
    
     See the [Onboarding to the SSG Training Ecosystem DL Network](Specifications/md_files/onboarding/SSG_DLT_Onboarding.md#Distributed-Ledger-Interface) document for implementing the Distributed Ledger Interface. We have provided a sample DL Interface code which is available in JAVA and .NET versions. You may download the [Sample DL Interface Code](Interface-Reference-Implementation).

7. Once you have done the setup, perform the connectivity to SSG Training Ecosystem DLT Network by submitting and reading transactions via your DL Interface.
   
8. Perform DLT [Conformance Test](ConformanceTestFile.xlsx). Inform the support team if you encounter any connectivity issues. Submit the DLT Conformance Test to SSG for the sign off.

> For any issues or feedback, please raise a ticket via the [Jira Support Channel](Jira-Support-Channel.pdf).
